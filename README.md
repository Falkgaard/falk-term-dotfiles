# falk-term-dotfiles
Collection of personal terminal-related dotfiles (KiTTy, fish, Starship, etc...)

# Disclaimer:
There are a lot of garbage in these that are either hard-coded for my personal needs, WIP, legacy left-overs, half-assed, or in need of porting and/or proper integration (e.g. old bash/zsh stuff that I haven't adapted to fish yet).

So use these dotfiles at your own risk (but feel free to modify them as you see fit).

But if you do extend, say, the Starship configuration in a style-compliant way to support the things that I haven't bothered with adding theming for, please let me know and I might add them for future interested parties. üëç
